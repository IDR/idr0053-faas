Zebrafish Embryo,Sagittal section color,Danio rerio,NCBITaxon,NCBITaxon 7955,5-day post-fertilization zebrafish embryo,PyramidTiff,"A TEM image of a 5 dpf zebrafish embryo sagittal section pseudocolored to indicate various different tissue types.  Shown is a transmission electron microscopy image of a sagittal section of a 5-day post-fertilization zebrafish embryo that has been pseudocolored to indicate various different tissue types. This image is a virtual slide derived by stitching together 26,434 individual images. Color code: sage = brain lavender = cartilage dark brown = eye sand = intestine mauve = liver peach = muscle light pink = notochord bright green = olfactory pit eggplant = pancreas yellow = pronephric duct aquamarine = yolk."

Shown is a transmission electron microscopy image of a sagittal section of a 5-day post-fertilization zebrafish embryo. This image is a virtual slide derived by stitching together 26,434 individual images."
Mouse Fibroblast,Unstained,Mus musculus,NCBITaxon,NCBITaxon 10090,mouse embryonic fibroblast,PyramidTiff,"A cryo-electron microscopy image of a thin part of an unstained, vitrified mouse embryonic fibroblast.  Shown is a cryo-electron transmission electron microscopy image of a thin part of an unstained, vitrified mouse embryonic fibroblast. This image is a virtual slide derived by stitching together 117 individual images."
Mouse Glomerulus,DAB precip,Mus musculus,NCBITaxon,NCBITaxon 10090,mouse glomerulus,PyramidTiff,"An overlay of RCM and TEM images of two sequential 60 nm sections of a mouse glomerulus labeled for albumin with DAB peroxidase.  Shown is an overlay of reflection contrast microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images of two sequential 60 nm sections of a mouse glomerulus. Albumin was localized by DAB peroxidase staining and is colored yellow in the RCM image, whereas the DAB precipitate is black in the T image. The RCM and TEM images each are virtual slides derived by stitching together 5 and 990 individual images, respectively."
Human Dendritic,Immunogold,Homo sapiens,NCBITaxon,NCBITaxon 9606,human dendritic cells,PyramidTiff,"An immunogold-labeled section of reovirus-infected human dendritic cells showing the localization of  reovirus _3 pseudocolored in green.  Shown is an immunogold-labeled, ultrathin cyro-section of reovirus-infected human dendritic cells using an anti-reovirus _3 antibody, a bridging rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody, and protein A-gold particles 10 nm in diameter. The 10 nm gold particles were automatically detected and highlighted by green Gaussian profiles with 235 nm FWHM so that their locations show up at all magnifications. The underlying TEM image is a virtual slide derived by stitching together 441 individual images."
